## Intro

This relatively short course will cover some key elements on how to secure your code.

Most of the web app 'hacking' courses put main effort on teaching how to break applications.
That approach is all fine, but such a broad subject cannot realistically be covered in 6 sessions.

So - in order to squeeze as much information as possible in our sessions, some of the 'hottest' topics will be discussed in greater detail (including practical exercises), while for some further research must be done by students themselves. 

It's organized in following sections (on some sessions we could cover multiple topics, while some others could take more time):

- OWASP Top 10 (2021) vulnerabilities:
  - [ ]  A01:2021-Broken Access Control
  - [ ]  A02:2021-Cryptographic Failures
  - [ ]  A03:2021-Injection
  - [ ]  A04:2021-Insecure Design
  - [ ]  A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration
  - [ ]  A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components 
  - [ ]  A07:2021-Identification and Authentication Failures
  - [ ]  A08:2021-Software and Data Integrity Failures
  - [ ]  A09:2021-Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
  - [ ]  A10:2021-Server-Side Request Forgery
- Some additional stuff:
  - [ ]  Risks of 3rd party code libraries
  - [ ]  Web application attack methodology
  - [ ]  Brief coverage of network attacks
- âœ¨ Some more magik if we have time left âœ¨

## What's the plan
As mentioned previously - not everything can be fully covered in such a brief timespan, so we will have to adapt and improvise. 

Meaning - as much as possible practical demos will be done in sessions, leaving most of the student assignments as homeworks.

Assignments involving the challenges will be marked with ðŸ‘¾ symbol.\
The more ðŸ‘¾ðŸ‘¾ðŸ‘¾, the harder it should be (but of course, depends on your previous experience on subject).

## Requirements

**Basic understanding of how web application works and interacts with different services:**

- HTTP GET/POST requests and headers
- Basic JS
- Basic SQL
- Session handling
- APIs
- Basic web cryptography, like SSL/TLS
- We will not have much time to play around with scripting, but Python is fun :)

## ToDo

1. **Since everybody knows that it's quite hard to do 'hacking' on Windows, we need some kind of Linux OS to get most of the tools working. You can choose from these two Debian based distros:**
- [Kali Linux] - Most widely used Linux distro for cyber-sec
- [Parrot OS] - Same features as Kali, so just a matter of preference

2. **You can install the Linux OS as a Virtual Machine on your host PC using any of these tools:**

- [VirtualBox] - Easy to install/use virtualization software (Win/macOS/Linux)
- [VMware Player] - VMware Windows software (Win/macOS (called VMware Fusion)/Linux)

    *If you are already using a Linux, technically you can skip this and install all the tools manually, but anyway VM is a way to go in case you break something (just revert from Snapshot and keep hacking).

3. **Install the Juice Shop web application locally, so we have a 'real-life' web app running - there we will have demos and practice done:**
- [Juice Shop] - Intentionally vulnerable AngularJS based web application.  [Install instructions](/01/resources/juice_shop_install.md)
- Other vulnerable web apps could be used later in the course, but if needed we will install them later.

4. **Get ready to intercept HTTP requests:**
- [Burp Suite Community Edition] - An integrated platform/graphical tool for performing security testing of web applications
- [FoxyProxy Standard] - A firefox browser extension to quickly switch between browser proxy settings
